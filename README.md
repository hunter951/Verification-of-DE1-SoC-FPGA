With a team of 5 student engineers, developed a testbench for the DE1-SoC Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) 
to detect any changes in performance of the system after implementation of protection technology by DEVCOM Army Research Lab

final.qar is the Quartus II archive for the program to be flashed to the DE1-SoC that will utilize a high percentage of board resources to stress the board.

memDump.tcl extracts the memory contents from the RAMs created in the final.qar and puts the data into .mif files

mif_processor.py then extracts the data in the mif files generated by memDump.tcl and inserts the data into .csv files. This is for the creation of graphs, tables 
and other form of presentable media of the data to achieve the goal of comparing functional correctness of onboard FPUs pre board modification and post board modification.
